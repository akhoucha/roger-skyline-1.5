| Setup |
---------

:: Sudo ::

- Log in as the non-root user
- `su` to log in as root
- `apt-get install sudo && apt-get install vim`
- `vi /etc/sudoers`
- Add to the file :
	username	ALL(ALL:ALL) ALL
- You can now exit to go back to your non-root user and use sudo when you need root privileges

:: Static IP ::

- `sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces`
- Remove or comment the already existing enp0s3 interface
- Cluster 3 example :
auto enp0s3
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enpo0s3 inet static
	address 10.13.42.21 # Must be in the same network as host, and not already taken
	netmask 255.255.255.252 # netmask /30
	gateway 10.13.254.254 # Same as host
	broadcast 10.13.255.255 # Same as host
	dns-nameservers 10.52.1.42 # Same as host
- 10.1X.0.0 is the network needed where X is the cluster
- dns-nameservers is the same for cluster 1, 2 and 3
- `sudo reboot`
